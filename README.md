# **🍰 Ingredients To Make Chocolate Cake 🍰**

**1.** &nbsp;2 cups all-purpose flour



**2.** &nbsp;2 cups white sugar

   

**3.** &nbsp;¾ cup unsweetened cocoa

   

**4.**  &nbsp;2 teaspoons baking soda

   

**5.** &nbsp;1 teaspoon baking powder

   

**6.** &nbsp;½ teaspoon salt

   

**7.** &nbsp;2 eggs

   

**8.** &nbsp;1 cup cold brewed coffee

   

**9.** &nbsp;1 cup milk

   

**10.** &nbsp;½ cup vegetable oil

    

**11.** &nbsp;2 teaspoons vinegar



# **💡 Directions 💡**
 `Step 1:`&nbsp;&nbsp;
Preheat oven to `350` degrees F (`175` degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch pan.

 `Step 2:`&nbsp;&nbsp;
In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the eggs, coffee, milk, oil and vinegar. Mix until smooth; the batter will be thin. Pour the batter into the prepared pan.

 `Step 3:`&nbsp;&nbsp;
Bake in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
